<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to
    write Web Pages.
    </p>

   <ul>
       <li> Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
        together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.</li>
       <li> As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to
        simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
        it to display.</li>
       <li>Html is a language used to give structure to a web site</li>
       <li>html is a markup language and script language</li>
       <li>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</li>
   </ul>
   
<p>Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
    headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
    between researchers.
    </p>

    <p>Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available
        in HTML language.</p>

<p>HTML Tags</p>

<p>As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the
    content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces &lt; Tag Name >. <br> Except few tags, most
    of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example, &lt; html> has its closing
    tag</html> and &lt; body> tag has its closing tag  &lt;/body> tag etc.
    </p>
    <p>Above example of HTML document uses the following tags:</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>tag</td>
        <td>description</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> &lt; !DOCTYPE...></td>
        <td> This tag defines the document type and HTML version</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt; html>
        </td>
        <td>This tag encloses the complete HTML document and mainly comprises
            of document header which is represented by &lt;head>...&lt;/head> and
            document body which is represented by &lt;body>...&lt;/body> tags.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;/head></td>
        <td>This tag represents the document's header which can keep other HTML
            tags like &lt;title>, &lt;link> etc.&lt;/td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;title> </td>
        <td>The &lt;title> tag is used inside the &lt;head> tag to mention the
            document title.
            </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;/body></td>
        <td>This tag represents the document's body which keeps other HTML tags
            like &lt;h1>, &lt;div>, &lt;p> etc.&lt;/td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;h1> </td>
        <td>This tag represents the heading.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>&lt;p></td>
        <td> This tag represents a paragraph</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>To learn HTML, you will need to study various tags and understand how they behave, while
    formatting a textual document. Learning HTML is simple as users have to learn the usage of
    different tags in order to format the text or images to make a beautiful webpage.</p>
<p>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends to use lowercase tags starting from HTML
    4.</p>
<p>HTML Document Structure</p>

<p>A typical HTML document will have the following structure:</p>

<img src="" alt="">

<!-- ==== sub-heading ==== -->
<p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE> Declaration
</p>

<p>The &lt;!DOCTYPE> declaration tag is used by the web browser to understand the version of
    the HTML used in the document. Current version of HTML is 5 and it makes use of the following
    declaration:
    </p>
<img src="" alt="">

<p>There are many other declaration types which can be used in HTML document depending on
    what version of HTML is being used. We will see more details on this while discussing
    &lt;!DOCTYPE...> tag along with other HTML tags.</p>
